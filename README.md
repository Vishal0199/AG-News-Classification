# AG-News-Classification

## Introduction:
The objective of this task is to build a text classification model using the state-of-art method to classify a dataset of text into one of multiple categories.  
I have chosen the AG News dataset which consists of news articles labelled as [1-World, 2-Sports, 3-Business, 4-Sci/Tech].
Each class contains 30,000 training samples and 1,900 testing samples.
